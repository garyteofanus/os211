# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)  
    Remembering today's pop quiz, you know that page replacement algorithm is in one of the question. If you are interested to learn more about the algorithm, I suggest you read this article. In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in. This website explains a ton of things about those algorithm and it's great if you want to learn more.

2. [Operating System - Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)  
    A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. Check out this website that I used to learn more abiut virtual memory.	

3. [Dynamic memory allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/new-vs-malloc-and-free-vs-delete-in-c/)  
    On C++ there exist new and delete operator to dynamically allocate memory addess. On C there are `malloc()` and `calloc()`. The have close functionality but there are still difference. You can check this website to learn more about the difference between them. Maybe you can find one interesting or more!

4. [NUMA](https://medium.com/@agarwalmansi05/non-uniform-memory-access-numa-59ce7f7d1860)  
    NUMA or Non-Uniform Memory Access, is a system which is used in a computer which contains multiple physical CPUs. Now, what does that mean? Well, just click on the link to find out more. This medium post explains it with beautiful illustration. 

5. [What are benefits of virtual memory?](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/what-are-benefits-of-virtual-memory)  
    Continuing my explanation about virtual memory, you may be wondering what's the benefit of using virtual memory. Well, you're on the right time, click on the link above to learn more. This website explains the benefit of using virtual memory concisely in a bullet point.

6. [Why does chrome use a ton of memory?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFT9rKt7HpI)  
    Chrome is undoubtedly the predominant browser on the market. But you might be wondering why it took almost all of your memory (RAM). This YouTube video explains the reason why while also explaining a bit about memory. This video also explains it with cool animation and it makes a fun video to watch.

7. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)  
    An important aspect of operating systems, virtual memory is implemented using demand paging. Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process. A frame is the smallest fixed-length contiguous block of physical memory into which memory pages are mapped by the operating system. To allocate a fram you need an algorithm, also the number of frames can also dynamically change depending on using local or global replacement. This website explains all of that ina detatiled way.

8. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)  
    Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. This article explains all that with a good problem and also a solution for you to think on.

9. [Optimizing C and C++ code](https://medium.com/@aka.rider/how-to-optimize-c-and-c-code-in-2018-bd4f90a72c2b)  
    We are still limited by current hardware technology. That's way we need to optimize our code so we can make best use of the hardware performance we have. If you code in C or C++ or even just a beginer, you can definitely check out this website to know about some tips or tricks to squeeze the best performance of your code. 
There are tons of example here, each with detailed explanation and examples which makes it a good read.

10. [Windows Exploitation Tricks](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/01/windows-exploitation-tricks-trapping.html)  
    Regarding topic of virtual memory, this website explains about the security side of virtual memory. A blog about someone exploiting the virtual memory on Windows. A eally interesting article if you have interest in csbersecurity.

That's all from me for this week topic. See you on the next one ðŸ‘‹
